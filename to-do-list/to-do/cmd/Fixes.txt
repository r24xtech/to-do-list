Qubes aims at being an everyday OS where you isolate different apps from each other by giving each its own full virtual machine. It gives a nice balance of usability (your data and installed applications persist across reboots, for example) and security (things are isolated from each other, and it's quick and easy to for example, create a clean VM, paste in some sketchy links that you didn't want to open in your banking VM, and then destroy the VM).
